#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/CdaPXivTfNA

#### Description:

The Advanced Wordlist Generator is a versatile and customizable tool designed for security researchers, ethical hackers, and developers. This project simplifies the process of creating comprehensive wordlists for password testing, penetration testing, and other security-related applications. With features like leet-speak transformations, reversed combinations, and flexible configurations, this tool enables users to generate targeted wordlists with ease.

## Key Features:

### Customizable Wordlist Generation

Combine words, numbers, and special characters to create wordlists tailored to specific needs. Users can define their own components or utilize preexisting sets, ensuring full control over the generated content.

### Leet Transformations

Automatically generate leet-speak variations of words, such as replacing 'e' with '3', 'a' with '4', or 'o' with '0'. This feature expands the wordlist's versatility, particularly for testing passwords that include common substitutions.

### Reversible Combinations

Increase coverage by including reversed versions of words and phrases. For instance, "password" can also be included as "drowssap" to account for reversal-based variations.

### Flexible Settings

Configure various settings, such as:
- Minimum and maximum word lengths.
- Inclusion of capitalized variations.
- Toggle options for leet transformations and reversed combinations.

### Save and Load Configurations

Save component configurations and settings to JSON files for reuse. This feature ensures efficiency and consistency across multiple sessions.

### Rich User Interface

Leverages the `rich` library for an interactive and visually appealing console experience. Features include styled menus, tables, and real-time feedback.

## Design Choices:

### Rich Library

The `rich` library was chosen for its ability to create an engaging and user-friendly command-line interface. Styled menus, tables, and panels improve usability, making the tool accessible to users of all technical levels.

### JSON for Configurations

Using JSON for saving and loading configurations ensures human-readable, portable, and easily editable files. This choice facilitates interoperability with other tools and simplifies debugging.

### Modular and Iterative Design

The project is designed in a modular fashion, with separate functions for each task. This approach promotes ease of testing, debugging, and future extension. Features were added incrementally to ensure each part worked flawlessly before moving to the next.
